# Analysis-of-Speeches-of-Two-Different-Languages-to-Identify-Suspicious-Contents
Developed a system to categorize speeches of two different languages into suspicious and nonsuspicious categories based on long short-term memory (LSTM) which is a variant of recurrent neural network (RNN). For the purpose of training and validating our model, we took into account speeches in the Bangla and English languages and our dataset has roughly 37386 suspicious and non-suspicious Bangla and English texts. Moreover, the system can automatically identify the language of the given input speech whether it is in Bengali language or in English language.
